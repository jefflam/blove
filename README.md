Alright Jeff, self-hackathon, let's go!

1) Hi-fi design is more or less done with photoshop
2) Some design screens missing, but check wunderlist
3) Gonna use angularjs as frontend framework and perhaps inject data (so no need to wire up a backend) Also using bootstrap.
4) If need to wire up backend, use Firebase
5) Or use node. But we will see.
